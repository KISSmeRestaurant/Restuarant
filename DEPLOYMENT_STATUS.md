## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Status:** Code pushed to GitHub ✅  
**Render Deployment:** In Progress ⏳  
**Expected Time:** 2-5 minutes from push  
**Backend URL:** https://restuarant-sh57.onrender.com

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
- Check your Render dashboard for deployment completion
- Look for "Build successful" message in logs

### Step 2: Test the Feature
1. Login as admin in your application
2. Navigate to User Management page
3. Find a staff user
4. Try toggling the "Tables" and "Kitchen" permission checkboxes
5. **Expected Result:** Checkboxes should work without 404 errors

### Step 3: Verify Staff Dashboard
1. Login as a staff user whose permissions you modified
2. Check that only permitted tabs are visible:
   - **Tables permission enabled:** Shows Tables and Orders tabs
   - **Kitchen permission enabled:** Shows Kitchen and Orders tabs
   - **Both disabled:** Shows only Feedback tab

## 🔧 Quick Test (Browser Console)

After deployment completes, run this in browser console:

```javascript
fetch('https://restuarant-sh57.onrender.com/api/admin/staff/test/permissions', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ tableAccess: true, dashboardAccess: false })
}).then(r => console.log('Status:', r.status, r.status === 401 ? '✅ Working!' : '❌ Still deploying...'));
```

**Expected Result:** Status 401 (means endpoint exists but needs authentication)
